NAME
    Games::Lacuna::Task - Automation framework for the Lacuna Expanse MMPOG

SYNOPSIS
        my $task   = Games::Lacuna::Task->new(
            task    => ['recycle','repair'],
            config  => {
                recycle => ...
            },
        );
        $task->run();

    or via commandline (see "lacuna_task" in bin and "lacuna_run" in bin)

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a framework for implementing various automation
    tasks for the Lacuna Expanse MMPOG. It provides

    *   a way of customizing which tasks to run in which order

    *   a convinient command line interface

    *   a logging mechanism

    *   configuration handling

    *   cache for increasing speed and reducing rpc calls

    *   simple access to the Lacuna API (via Games::Lacuna::Client)

    *   many useful helper methods and roles

    *   implements several common tasks

CONFIGURATION
    Games::Lacuna::Task uses a yaml configuration file which is loaded from
    the database directory (defaults to ~/.lacuna). The filename should be
    config.yml or lacuna.yml.

    If you run "lacuna_task" for the first time the programm will guide you
    through the setup process and create a basic config file.

    Example config.yml

     ---
     connect:
       name: "empire_name"          
       password: "empire_password"  
       uri: "http://..."            # optional
       api_key: "a1f9...."          # optional
     global:
       task: 
         - excavate
         - bleeder
         - repair
         - dispose
       dispose_percentage: 80
     excavate: 
       excavator_count: 3

    The data of the configuration file must be a hash with hash keys
    corresponding to the lowecase task names. The hash key 'global' should
    be used for global settings.

    global.task specifies which tasks should be run by default and is only
    used if no tasks have been set explicitly (e.g. via command line).

    global.exclude specifies which tasks should be skipped default and is
    only used if no tasks have been set explicitly or via config.

    global.exclude_planet and *.exclude_planet can be used to exclude
    certain bodies from being processed.

    All other values in the global section are used as default values for
    tasks. (e.g. the 'dispose_percentage' setting can be used by the
    WasteMonument and the WasteDispose task)

    Username, password, empire name, api key and server url must be stored
    under the connect key in the config file.
